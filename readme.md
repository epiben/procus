# SMS-based data collection
This repo is under construction but will contain the code required to collect data from respondents via SMS, using Twilio.

The `app/.env` file (not in repo) should contain authentication information for Twilio, namely the following three entries:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID=
```
